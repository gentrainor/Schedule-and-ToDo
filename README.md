Description


Schedule and ToDo is an application designed for students to be able to add their class schedule as well as their assignments, exams and tasks for them to better view it. In the class schedule you are able to add the important details that belong to a schedule and you can add as many classes as you wish to. You are also able to edit all of your classes if anything changes. In the ToDo tab it takes you to your ToDo List where you can add as many different assignments, exams and tasks as you wish to. This screen also has a unique filter feature that allows you to filter by topic, due date or completion. 

This project was created as the first part of the CS 2340 Project.
